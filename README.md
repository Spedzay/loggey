# loggey [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/spedzay/loggey/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/spedzay/loggey)
A cross platform(NOT YET) C++17 single-header console logging library

## How to use?
you can compile using cmake to build the example,
but you could easily just use g++ or another compiler from the command line
and build loggey.hpp and loggey.cpp

Loggey.hpp is the code for all of loggey
and loggey.cpp is a demo application.
